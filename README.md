## About

This repo contains some layouts I am building with CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to replace old Bootstrap pages. The layout itself is very shallow, but I am trying to make it compreehensive and abragent in order to fit desktop and mobile version and to have some flexibility in order to be converted to a VueJS or ReactJS project in the future.
